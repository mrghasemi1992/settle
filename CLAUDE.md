# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code / CLI when working in this repository. This file is the
source of truth for conventions — when in doubt, follow this over inferring from
surrounding code.

## Project

A local-first personal finance and budgeting app. No backend. All data lives in
IndexedDB via Dexie. Built as a portfolio piece — code quality, accessibility,
and design polish matter as much as functionality.

## Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Dexie (IndexedDB) — primary data layer, `useLiveQuery` for reactive reads
- Zustand — ONLY for ephemeral UI state that isn't persisted data (e.g. active
  modal, selected date range in a picker). If it can be derived from Dexie via
  `useLiveQuery`, it does not belong in a store.
- Zod — schema validation for CSV import, form input, and Dexie table shapes
- Radix UI primitives (unstyled) — for Dialog, Select, Popover, Tooltip, Tabs,
  and the Jalali date picker. Never import Radix's or any library's prebuilt
  _styled_ components (e.g. shadcn). Compose Radix primitives and style them
  from scratch in CSS Modules.
- CSS Modules + CSS custom properties for design tokens. No Tailwind, no
  CSS-in-JS, no third-party styled component kits.
- Vitest + React Testing Library (globals enabled, jsdom environment; setup
  file at `src/test/setup.ts`)
- react-router-dom — one route per top-level screen, each backed by a folder
  under `src/pages/`

## Folder structure & co-location

```

```

Component folders use lowercase names with generic, predictable file names
(`index.tsx`, `styles.module.css`, `spec.test.tsx`) rather than repeating the
component name in each filename. Co-locate tests, styles, and types next to
the component/feature that owns them. Shared/cross-feature code only lives in
top-level `components/`, `db/`, `styles/`.

`components/primitives/` holds generic, reusable, unstyled-in-isolation
building blocks (Button, Input, Card, Badge, Switch) with no dependency on
stores, i18n, or app-specific data shapes. `components/` (top level) holds
app-specific composed components that _may_ depend on stores/i18n
(ThemeToggle, TransactionRow, etc.). `pages/` holds one folder per route,
each exporting a single `<Name>Page` component consumed by `app.tsx`.

Components use named exports, never `export default`. A component's own
prop type is not exported — it's only ever consumed inside the file that
declares it, so name it plainly `Props` (not `ButtonProps`) rather than
exporting a type nothing outside the file uses.

**Event handlers**: a callback _prop_ is named `onX` (e.g. `onSave`,
`onAction`) — matching native DOM/React event prop naming, so components
compose the same way native elements do. A _local_ function that implements
the behavior (and optionally calls the prop) is named `handleX` (e.g.
`handleSave`) — never the same identifier as the prop, so there's no
destructure/rename collision between the two. Don't invent a `handleX`
wrapper just to forward a prop unchanged — `<Button onClick={onAction}>` is
fine as-is; only name a local handler when there's real logic in it.

**Barrel exports**: any folder that groups multiple sibling modules
(`components/`, `components/primitives/`, `stores/`, `i18n/`) gets an
`index.ts` re-exporting its public API — components/hooks/functions actually
consumed elsewhere, never internal-only prop types. Keep `components/` and
`components/primitives/` as two separate barrels rather than one re-exporting
the other, so every export has exactly one import path.

**Path aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`, declared in _both_
`tsconfig.app.json` (`compilerOptions.paths`, no `baseUrl` — this TS version
deprecates it, paths resolve relative to the tsconfig file itself) and
`vite.config.ts` (`resolve.alias`). These are two independent tools: the
tsconfig entry only affects the type-checker/editor, the Vite entry is what
actually resolves imports at dev/build time (and Vitest inherits it since
it's built on Vite) — both must be kept in sync by hand. Use `@/...` for any
import that would otherwise need `../` traversal; same-directory/sibling
imports stay relative.

## Design tokens & theming

- All colors, spacing, radii, shadows, font sizes are CSS custom properties in
  `styles/tokens.css`, overridden per-theme in `theme-light.css` / `theme-dark.css`.
- System theme preference respected via `prefers-color-scheme`, with a manual
  override stored in `localStorage` (light/dark/system three-way toggle).
- Never hardcode a color or spacing value in a component's `.module.css` —
  always reference a token.
- Don't use the inline `style` prop for values that are the same on every
  render — give them a class in `styles.module.css` instead (see
  `pages/foundations` for the pattern: per-item loop values like a token name
  or a scale's pixel width stay inline since they can't be static classes;
  everything else, including one-off layout tweaks, becomes a named class).
  The one standing exception is a CSS custom property computed from a prop at
  runtime (e.g. `Badge` setting `--badge-hue`) — that's not expressible as a
  static class either.

**Color semantics — standing rules for every phase, not just Foundations:**

- Positive/income amounts carry no dedicated hue — body text color plus a
  "+" prefix only. Only outflow/expense amounts get a color (the accent
  named "Rust" in the token set). Don't introduce a "positive" color.
- Category badge colors must never reuse the Rust/negative hue — a category
  tag should never visually compete with "this is a loss."
- Categories are user-created, so `Badge` takes an arbitrary hex `color`
  prop, not a fixed enum. Only the hex's _hue_ is used — background/text are
  the hue rendered against fixed per-theme saturation/lightness bands (see
  `--badge-*` tokens in `theme-light.css`/`theme-dark.css`), so every badge
  reads as one system regardless of the exact shade picked. Any hue landing
  within 15° of Rust's (~13°) is automatically nudged to the nearest safe
  edge, enforcing the rule above even for arbitrary user input — see
  `components/primitives/badge/hue.ts`.
- The interactive accent ("Brass") is reserved for buttons, focus rings, and
  links only — never reused for positive/negative semantics, so the two
  color systems can't collide.

## Typography & fonts

- **Manrope** (Latin) + **Dana** (Persian, variable font) — self-hosted, no
  external font CDN.
- Dana's axes, verified directly from the font file: `wght` (10–900,
  **default 10**) and `KASH` (0–100, default 0 — kashida/justification
  stretch, not a width axis; leave at default, not used in this app).
- **⚠️ Dana's default weight is 10 (Hairline), not 400.** Every element using
  Dana must set weight explicitly — never rely on the unset default, or text
  renders nearly invisible. Named instances line up with the type scale:
  Regular=400 (Body), Medium=500 (Numeric), DemiBold=600 (Display).
- **Dana has no standard `tnum` OpenType feature** (confirmed via the font's
  GSUB table). `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` does nothing on Dana —
  use `font-feature-settings: "ss03"` instead for tabular Persian numerals.
  Manrope does support `tnum`, so the numeric/tabular type role needs both
  mechanisms applied, one per script, not a single shared rule.
- **Never use Dana's `ss02` feature** (visually reskins Latin digit
  characters as Persian digit glyphs). It breaks copy-paste and
  screen-reader semantics. Persian digits must be real Persian digit
  characters, produced via `Intl.NumberFormat` with the correct locale — see
  Currency below.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Manrope';
  src:
    url('/fonts/manrope-variable.woff2') format('woff2-variations'),
    url('/fonts/manrope-variable.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 200 800;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Dana';
  src:
    url('/fonts/dana-variable.woff2') format('woff2-variations'),
    url('/fonts/dana-variable.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 10 900;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

Both are woff2-only (universal browser support today) — no legacy `.woff`
fallback. See `styles/fonts.css`.

## i18n, RTL, calendars, currency

- Supported locales: `en` (LTR, Gregorian, USD/EUR), `fa` (RTL, Jalali, IRR).
- Use CSS logical properties (`margin-inline-start`, not `margin-left`, etc.)
  everywhere — never physical left/right properties — so RTL is automatic.
- `dir="rtl"`/`dir="ltr"` set at the document root based on active locale.
- Date handling: all dates stored in Dexie as ISO/Gregorian. Convert to Jalali
  only at the display layer via the Jalali plugin. Never store Jalali dates.
- Currency: store amounts as integer minor units (cents/rials, IRR uses 0 as
  its practical minor-unit exponent) in Dexie. Format for display via
  `Intl.NumberFormat` per active locale/currency, never by hand-building
  strings. This is also the only correct source of Persian digit characters
  — never produce them via a font feature (see Typography).
- `Intl.NumberFormat`'s currency symbol depends on the browser's _locale_
  data, not just the currency code — e.g. IRR renders as the code
  (`IRR 12,400,000`) under `en-US` and as the spelled-out word `ریال` under
  `fa-IR`, never a `﷼` glyph, in every browser tested. This is correct,
  expected `Intl` behavior for these locales, not a bug — don't hand-build a
  `﷼` symbol to "fix" it, that would violate the rule above.

## State management rules

1. Default to `useLiveQuery` reading directly from Dexie.
2. Reach for Zustand only for state with no natural persisted home (UI-only,
   session-only). Justify each store's existence in a comment at its top.

## Testing

- Every component gets a co-located `.test.tsx` covering rendered states and
  key interactions (not implementation details).
- Every Dexie query/mutation module gets a co-located `.test.ts`.
- Run the full suite before every commit.
- `npm run test:coverage` runs Vitest with the `@vitest/coverage-v8`
  provider (text + HTML reporters; HTML output goes to `coverage/`, which is
  gitignored). Barrel files (`components/index.ts`,
  `components/primitives/index.ts`, `stores/index.ts`, `i18n/index.ts`) are
  excluded by explicit path, not a `**/index.ts` glob — that glob also
  matches `index.tsx` component entry files and silently drops them from
  the report.

## Git & commits

- One feature phase per branch (e.g. `feature/transactions`, `feature/dashboard`).
- Conventional commit style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
- Merge only after tests pass and the phase's Claude Design import is fully
  implemented.
- Never run `git commit` without the user's explicit go-ahead first — this
  holds even in auto/yolo mode, where committing is otherwise not something
  to wait on for lower-stakes actions. Finish and verify the work, then ask.

## Design spec workflow (Claude Design ↔ Claude Code sync)

Each feature phase is designed in Claude Design first, then handed to Claude
Code via the native "Send to Claude Code" feature (`claude_design` MCP,
`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/design/mcp`), which imports the live design
project directly by URL. There is no hand-maintained spec file per feature —
the imported `.dc.html` project _is_ the spec, so it can't drift out of sync
with what was actually designed.

If implementation surfaces a decision the design doesn't cover — a technical
constraint, an accessibility requirement, a font/library quirk discovered
along the way — record it directly in the relevant section of this file, so
`CLAUDE.md` stays the single source of truth for anything not visible in the
design itself.

## Phase order

1. Foundations (tokens, theming, i18n/RTL scaffold, base primitives)
2. App shell & navigation (locale + theme switcher wired in) — `react-router-dom`
   and the `app.tsx` route table already exist from Foundations (a single
   `/foundations` route hosting the token/primitive showcase); this phase is
   the actual navigation chrome and additional routes, not initial router setup
3. Transactions (CRUD, list/table)
4. Dashboard
5. Reports
6. Budgeting
7. Import/Export (incl. CSV)
8. Backup & sync (Google Drive, iCloud export)
